# Initiation solidity and Web3.0

## Introduction
Duration: 0:05:00

Welcome to this initiation Solidity and Web3! Let's learn how a Smart Contract contract works! ‚õµÔ∏è

We think those technologies are empowering, and open a brand new world of possibilities
of what we can achieve as developers. It also brings more power into the hands of the user.

We've made this project to have a better understanding of the NFT trend, and also to get our hands dirty.  

Now you will too üòú

During this workshop, you will:

- create your first Solidity smart contract
- test our contract
- deploy it on a real blockchain
- integrate and interact with it in a small react application using web3.js

To make this workshop more fun we will use a [small site made by Zenika](https://pimpmyduck.zenika.com/) that allows us to customize a duck ü¶Ü .

What we want to do here is to create an NFT based on our custom duck! That will make us explore all the things we list above. üôå

Are you ready? Let's go! üöÄ


## Init your project üî®
Duration: 0:05:00


### Prerequisites

üõ† If you don't have yarn installed you can install it globally like that 
```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

### Clone the repo

If you have not done it yet, you can start by cloning this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gosunet/workshop-initiation-solidity-web3.git
```

If we take a look at the structure, we can notice it's a monorepo using yarn workspaces.  

At the root, you can see a folder name `packages`. In this folder, we have separated packages.

We will focus on two packages today: `app` and `hardhat`.

The first contains our frontend, and the second will contains our contract.

Now we've seen that, let's start building! üöÄ


### Setup Hardhat

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start) is a framework that will help us to:
- compile our smart contract
- test our smart contract
- deploy our smart contract

If you feel adventurous you can alternatively use [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/) or [Fundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). Both are pretty similar to Hardhat in terms of features.

Because installing hardhat in a monorepo is a little bit tricky, we set up dependencies for you.

You can still take a look at the dependencies listed in `packages/hardhat/package.json`.

Now is the time to init hardhat in your `packages/hardhat` folder 
```sh
cd packages/hardhat
yarn install
yarn hardhat
```

Choose to create a new TypeScript project, then accept the following step.

This will create folders:
- `contracts`: folder for our solidity files,
- `scripts`: a directory that contains scripts to handle deployment, run, ...
- `test`: unit test sources
- `hardhat-config.js`: config file for Hardhat

Finally, run `yarn hardhat node`.  
This command runs a local Ethereum node on your machine. You have now a BlockChain running! 
It also prints out a bunch of accounts full of ethers that we can use to test our application.

Hardhat will generate some files for you, to make sure everything is working, run:

```sh
 yarn hardhat compile
```

This is interesting, we **compile** our code. This means Ethereum (or more precisely the "Ethereum Virtual Machine") 
works with a compiled version of our program, also called **byte code**.

Then run:

```sh
 yarn hardhat test
```

You should see a bunch of tests succeeded üéâ

You can now delete `Lock.js` under test, `deploy.ts` under scripts and `Lock.sol` under contracts. (not the folder!)

## Write your first smart contract üÜï
Duration: 0:20:00


Now that we have set up Hardhat let's create our first smart contract!  

You will write code in Solidity. If you don't know it (and we guess that's why you are here üòú),
don't panic.  

The language is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript. 

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

You can find the doc [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org) if you want to get an overview.

Let's create a new file `MyEpicSmartContract.sol` under `contracts` folder.  
Be careful file structure is important!

Copy this into your newly created file

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract MyEpicSmartContract {
    constructor() {
        console.log("Hello World !");
    }
}
```


‚ÑπÔ∏è If you use visual code you can install the [solidity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity&utm_source=buildspace.so&utm_medium=buildspace_project) for syntax highlighting.


Congratulation you have officially written your first smart contract ü•≥  
Easy no?

Let's explain it a bit.  

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
// ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  Necessary definition of the licence, per file

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
// ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  define the solidity version we use.

import "hardhat/console.sol";
// ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  Module imports 

// ‚¨áÔ∏è  We define our contract with the `contract` keyword. It's kind of `class` equivalent.
contract MyEpicSmartContract {

    // ‚¨áÔ∏è  If you know OOP, you're familiar with that üòù
    // If you're not, it's the first function called in our contract, 
    // when the contract is created = the contract is deployed for the first time.
    constructor() {
        console.log("Hello World !");
    }
}
```

The next step is to compile our smart contract, to do so run `yarn hardhat compile`.

Now it's our turn to work!  

Let's create a small function to set an attribute `name` into our smart contract. First, you will need to create a name attribute in your smart contract 

```javascript
contract MyEpicSmartContract {

    string name;
    
    ...
```

Then you can create your fonction 

```javascript
function setName(string newName) {
  name = newName;
}
```

Try to compile now!  
üí• You should get an error like that : `SyntaxError: No visibility specified. Did you intend to add "public"?`  

In solidity, like in some other language, you need to set the visibility of your function.  
Here we want this method to be callable from outside our contract so we need to add the `public` keyword like that 

```javascript
function setName(string x) public {
        name = x;
}
```

[Here](https://solidity-by-example.org/visibility/) is the visibility doc for Solidity if you are curious about other visibilities.

Head back to your terminal. Try to compile again. You should also see this error `TypeError: Data location must be "memory" or "calldata" for parameter in function, but none was given.`

The solidity compiler tells you here that you need to specify the [storage location](https://solidity-by-example.org/data-locations/) of your input name. You should use `calldata`, it's a special data location that contains function arguments, and the advantage is that it cost nothing. `memory` could work too but `calldata` is designed for input parameters so let's use this. 

This should be good for the `setName` method, go ahead and create a `sayHello` method now.

The function `sayHello` will simply use the name you just set to do a console log like that
```console.log("Hello <name> !");``` 

‚ÑπÔ∏è To concatenated strings, you can use `string.concat` method.

Again, here is a [link](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html) to help you with that.

Let's see how to run it!

### A script to run our contract 

Hardhat allows us to deploy our smart contract in a local blockchain, and it allows us to do it very easily.

We just have to write a small script to do that, so let's go!

Create a file `run.ts` under `scripts`.

```typescript
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

async function main() {
  const contract = await ethers.deployContract("MyEpicSmartContract");
  await contract.waitForDeployment();

  console.log(
    `Contract deployed to : ${await contract.getAddress()}`
  );
  const tx = await contract.setName("Sunny Tech");
  await tx.wait();
  await contract.sayHello();
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

To call your script just run `yarn hardhat run scripts/run.ts`.

You should get something like that!

```bash
Hello World !
Contract deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
Hello Sunny Tech !
```

`0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3` is here the contract address in our local blockchain where the contract was deployed.


## Create a contract that mints NFTs ü¶Ü
Duration: 0:20:00

It's all fun and stuff but our contract is not doing anything useful for our use case.

Let's change that! What we want is a contract that enables us to `mint` an NFT. Mint just means to create our NFT in the blockchain.

But what's an NFT? On the EVM-compatible blockchain, an NFT is "just" an ERC-721 [token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/), which means that our smart contract should implement the ERC-721 interface!

That's a lot of work. Fortunately for us in Solidity, we can use inheritance and there are open-source contracts available that we can inherit from to do that! [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin) is probably the most know for that, is popular, used by a lot of people, and secure (at least it has been audited strongly and used in the real world without flaws).

You can delete the name attribut and function we created before!

We first need to add the OpenZeppelin dependency.
In the `harhdat` folder run:

```bash
yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts
```

Then import them in our contract like that:

```typescript
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
```

As you can see we also import `Counters.sol`, this will help us to generate our NFT id.

Now that we have imported the contract `ERC721URIStorage` what we need to do now is to make our contract inherit from it.

To do that it's pretty simple!

```javascript
// We inherit the contract we imported. This means we'll have access
// to the inherited contract's methods.
contract MyEpicSmartContract is ERC721URIStorage {

  // We need to pass the name of our NFTs token and it's symbol.
  constructor() ERC721 ("CryptoDuck", "DUCK") {
    console.log("This is my NFT contract. Woah!");
  }
```

You will see that here we need to call the `ERC721` contract constructor with two strings, one for the name of our NFT token, and the other one for the symbol of our collection.

Feel free to name it as you want üòâ

Now we can use the `ERC721` contract method!  
Let's create the method that we will call to create our NFT that will represent our custom duck.  
We don't want to store the whole duck SVG in our contract because storage in the blockchain costs money üí∞ so we will only store the URL to access our duck SVG. 

‚ÑπÔ∏è Remember that data in the blockchain are immutable, this is why our URL must be accessible FOREVER! That's why it's strongly recommended to store our image in a decentralized store file system like IPFS.


```solidity
function makeAnEpicNFT(string memory srcTokenUri) public { 

}
```

Each of our NFTs will need a unique ID to do that we will use the `Counters.sol` we have imported.

Add this to your contract:

```solidity
using Counters for Counters.Counter;
Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;
```

Let's code our contract to mint an NFT now!

First, we want to get the current ID for your new NFT.

```solidity
uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
````

Then we will mint our NFT calling the method from the OpenZeppelin contract (all internal methods are prefixed with an underscore)

```solidity
_safeMint(msg.sender, newItemId);
```

Notice `msg.sender` here, it's a magic solidity variable that holds the address of the wallet that calls this method.

We want our NFT to have an image, to do that we will create a `payload` that respects some convention used to parse NFT. By doing that our NFT will be readable in a marketplace like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or the metamask wallet. We also want our payload to be as tiny as possible, that's why we will encode it in base64.

```javascript
// Get all the JSON metadata in place and base64 encode it.
string memory json = Base64.encode(
    string(
        abi.encodePacked(
            '{"name": "Crypto Duck", "description": "A magnificent crypto duck.", "image": "', srcTokenUri, '"}'
        )
    )
);

// Just like before, we prepend data:application/json;base64, to our data.
string memory finalTokenUri = string(
    abi.encodePacked("data:application/json;base64,", json)
);
```

Feel free again to change the name or description of our Duck. Maybe you can have a dynamic name and a description? Use a name set in the frontend? 

To be able to use the `Base64.encode` we need to add the Base64 library to our project.  
Create a `libraries` package under `contracts` and create a file `Base64.sol` in it. You can find the content of this file [here](https://github.com/BlockChainCaffe/Base64.sol/blob/main/contracts/base64.sol).  
After that import the library into our contract file.

```javascript
import { Base64 } from "./libraries/Base64.sol";
```

Finally, we need to set the data to the NFT


```javascript
// Set the NFTs data.
_setTokenURI(newItemId, finalTokenUri);

console.log("An NFT w/ ID %s has been minted to %s", newItemId, msg.sender);
```

and increment the counter.

```javascript
// Increment the counter for when the next NFT is minted.
_tokenIds.increment();
```

One thing that we can do is to emit an Event, the front will be able to listen to that Event and show some stuff to the user.

To do that declare a new Event in our contract 

```javascript
event NewNFTMinted(address sender, uint256 tokenId);
```

and emit it at the end of your `makeAnEpicNFT` method.

```javascript
emit NewNFTMinted(msg.sender, newItemId);
```

At the end, you should get something like that:

```javascript
function makeAnEpicNFT(string memory srcTokenUri) public {
    // Get the current tokenId, this starts at 0.
    uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();

     // Actually mint the NFT to the sender using msg.sender.
    _safeMint(msg.sender, newItemId);

    // Get all the JSON metadata in place and base64 encode it.
    string memory json = Base64.encode(
        string(
            abi.encodePacked(
                '{"name": "Crypto Duck", "description": "A magnificent crypto duck.", "image": "', srcTokenUri, '"}'
            )
        )
    );

    // Just like before, we prepend data:application/json;base64, to our data.
    string memory finalTokenUri = string(
        abi.encodePacked("data:application/json;base64,", json)
    );

    // Set the NFTs data.
    _setTokenURI(newItemId, finalTokenUri);

    console.log("An NFT w/ ID %s has been minted to %s", newItemId, msg.sender);

    // Increment the counter for when the next NFT is minted.
    _tokenIds.increment();

    emit NewNFTMinted(msg.sender, newItemId);
  }
```

That's cool and stuff but how can I test my code? Let's see that in the next chapter!


## Test it!
Duration: 0:20:00

To test our smart contract we can update the `run.ts` script to create our contract and then call our new method `makeAnEpicNft`.

```typescript
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

async function main() {
    const contract = await ethers.deployContract("MyEpicSmartContract");
    await contract.waitForDeployment();

    console.log(
        `Contract deployed to : ${await contract.getAddress()}`
    );

    const svg = "https://theduckgallery.zenika.com/ducks/jeanphibaconnais.png"

    // Call the function.
    let txn = await contract.makeAnEpicNFT(svg)
    // Wait for it to be mined.
    await txn.wait()

    // Mint another NFT for fun.
    txn = await contract.makeAnEpicNFT(svg)
    // Wait for it to be mined.
    await txn.wait()
}

main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

Here we used a png that is not stored in decentralized storage, but it's just for the test so it's not a problem, you can use any png.

Is it working? üéâ

That's nice but I think we can have better a test, can we unit-test our contract? YES, we can!

Let's create a `MySmartContractSolTest.ts` file under the package `test`

We can test that we emit our `NewNFTMinted` event. It's pretty much the same code that the `run.ts` with some tests at the end.  

Here is the code:

```javascript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

describe('MyEpicSmartContract contract', function () {
  it('Should emit NewNFTMinted', async function () {
    const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners()

    const nftContract = await ethers.deployContract(
      'MyEpicSmartContract',
    )
    await nftContract.waitForDeployment()
    console.log('Contract deployed to:', await nftContract.getAddress())

    const svg = 'https://theduckgallery.zenika.com/ducks/jeanphibaconnais.png'

    await expect(nftContract.makeAnEpicNFT(svg))
      .to.emit(nftContract, 'NewNFTMinted')
      .withArgs(owner.address, 0) // first item
  })
})
```

We basically:
- `deploy` the contract on Hardhat test chain
- call the method `makeAnEpicNFT`
- and expect an event to be fire, using chai `expect`

To run it:

```javascript
yarn hardhat test
```

Awesome we now have our smart contract tested üòé


## Deploy your smart contract üöÄ
Duration: 0:20:00

Now that we have a working smart contract we want to deploy it on a real blockchain! So let's go üöÄ


### Get a Wallet! And some ETH üí∞

To deploy our smart contract we will need some Ethereum. Don't worry we will use the Sepolia testnet of Ethereum so this will not cost us a penny!

So if you don't already have a wallet, download the [Metamask extension](https://metamask.io/download/).

You will be guided on the setup phase by Metamask. When this part is done,
switch to `Sepolia network`, you should be on the Ethereum mainnet at first. If you don't see the `Sepolia network` click on "Show/hide testnet".

Once it's done you will see that you have 0 SepoliaETH üò¢

To get some SepoliaETH you will have to request some in a faucet!

This one should work [https://sepoliafaucet.com/](https://sepoliafaucet.com/), you gonna need to create an Alchemy account though but we will need one right after so do create one and request our SepoliaETH. To request your ETH just copy and paste in the input our public key address from Metamask (the one that looks like 0xf20...4D8 when you open it).

If you got some ETH let's go to the next part üî•

### Deploy

Deploying our contract is pretty much like running it with the `run.ts` script thanks to Hardhat. 

So let's create a new script `deploy.ts`:

```typescript
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

async function main() {
  const contract = await ethers.deployContract("MyEpicSmartContract");
  await contract.waitForDeployment();

  console.log(`Contract deployed to : ${await contract.getAddress()}`);

  const svg = "https://theduckgallery.zenika.com/ducks/jeanphibaconnais.png";
  const tx = await contract.makeAnEpicNFT(svg);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Minted NFT #1");
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

Now we have some setup to do.

First, you need to update your `hardhat.config` file.
We need to add a new network, here Sepolia, add this in the `module.export`: 

```javscript
networks: {
    sepolia: {
      url: process.env.STAGING_ALCHEMY_KEY_URL,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
```

Each time you want to deploy to a specific network you will need to add it like that in our Hardhat configuration. Pretty easy no?  
You can deploy to every EVM-compatible blockchain like that, even a blockchain like Avalanche üòâ

You have surely noticed the `process.env.STAGING_ALCHEMY_KEY_URL` and `process.env.PRIVATE_KEY` values.

Add the `PRIVATE_KEY` value in a `.env` file, to get the value of our private key, go to Metamask, click on the 3 dots next to our account, go to detail then click on "export private key".  
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è You should never share this key with anyone! Otherwise, some bad-intentioned people can still our account, and all that is within it!

To get the `STAGING_ALCHEMY_KEY_URL` you need to log in to [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) and then create a new 'app' with the create app button. You will be asked to choose a name, a description and a chain, do as you like for the name and description and choose the Ethereum chain with Sepolia network, you will get an HTTPS URL, this is our `STAGING_ALCHEMY_KEY_URL` that you need to add in your `.env` file.  
The alchemy app will act as a node to the Ethereum Sepolia network to interact with the blockchain.


Now that you set all the variables we need to add the `dotenv` dependency, in the `hardhat` folder run:

```bash
yarn add -D dotenv 
```

Then add the import on top of your Hardhat config file:

```typescript
require('dotenv').config();
```

Finally, run:

```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
```

You should get something like that:

```bash
Contract deployed to: 0x30382c5d151FFE1837c6BB0a1fdFaBc07FD0b67A
Minted NFT #1
```

Awesome you have deployed your first smart contract in the real world! And mint an NFT.

Currently, no NFT marketplace supports Sepolia tesnet üò¢

If we were using Goerli we would have been able to go to Opensea to see your NFT!
Creating an URL like this one: https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/sepolia/INSERT_DEPLOY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE/TOKEN_ID

But in Sepolia we have to use Metamask, so in Metamask go to the NFT tabs and import a new NFT. Put your contract address and your token id. And that's it! You should see your NFT üéâ

It's EPIC, but kinda boring it's the same SVG. Let's interact with it and create our duck!


## Frontend setup ‚öôÔ∏è
Duration: 0:05:00

Ok, we worked on a smart contract. It's a lot of fun, but we have only a part of the job.
What is the point of having a smart contract if nobody used it, right?

That's why we are now building a frontend. Not all the frontend, since we just want to build a web3 integration
on top of the [existing CrytoDuck made but our Zenika Teammate](https://pimpmyduck.zenika.com/).

The frontend is made in React, but don't worry if you don't know. 
We built for you the base components, you will just fill them. By doing that, we can focus on what really matters here: interacting with the blockchain ‚õì

As we saw in the introduction, we will work on `app` package.

First, let's start the front with `yarn start`. 
The interface should open on `http://localhost:3000/`, and you already have a functional application
to customize a duck, how cool is that?

What we want to do in this interface is:

- Connect our wallet to be able to interact with the wallet,
- Add a `mint` button to let the user create an NFT from his custom duck. 

To interact with the blockchain, we need a few additional dependencies, let's install them,
and then build some great stuff ‚ú®

In the `app` folder, do the following command:

```sh
yarn add @web3-react/core @web3-react/injected-connector @web3-react/metamask ethers @ethersproject/providers 
```

Those packages will be the tools we need to interact with the wallet, and by that, the blockchain.

Packages under `@web3-react/*` are bridges between react and client libraries such `ethers` 
(we are using) or `web3` library. It gives us 
friendly tools to get a reactive state in react components.

Now you probably want to yell at us: "GIVE ME SOME CODE!". We're getting there, don't worry üòâ

From now, you can launch the app in development mode by running `yarn start` in `src/app`.

## Configure your front to connect a Wallet üí∞
Duration: 0:25:00

### Context instantiation

As we saw, you add some dependencies to interact with the blockchain. 
This dependency needs to instantiate a `Context` to share the state with the whole app.
So the first modification we have to make is in the `App.tsx` component.  

First, import the context `Provider` and the Web3 library:

```tsx
import { Web3ReactProvider, initializeConnector } from '@web3-react/core'
import { MetaMask } from "@web3-react/metamask";
```

Now, we need to create the MetaMask connector. 
It will allow our application to the wallet you've installed, and interact with the BlockChain.
This declaration is static (does not changes between renders), so it should be declared **outside** the 
component (the `App` function).

```typescript
const metaMaskConnector = initializeConnector<MetaMask>((actions) => new MetaMask({ actions }))
```

Note: if you are building, you will need to handle more types of wallets, but `@web3-react` will provide you 
with all the needed connectors. Here, for our example, metaMask is enough. 

Then, wrap the whole JSX code in the `return` block by the Web3 provider:

```tsx
  // ...
  return (
    <Web3ReactProvider connectors={[metaMaskConnector]}>
      <div className={styles.app}>
        {/* ... */}
     </div>
    </Web3ReactProvider>
  )
```

Note the provider takes properties (commonly called `prop` in react) `connectors`.  
It is mandatory to initiate the web3 library we want to use. This makes `react-web3` agnostic of your
client library.  
Here, we pass the metamask connector previously initialized. This will allow us to connect our metaMask wallet. 

Great! Now we can discuss with the wallet in our React components!

### Connect to a wallet

The next code to update will be the **`Web3WalletConnector` component**.
This component will configure and handle all the connection logic. In that, we will find: 

- The chain configuration,
- Displaying a connection button the user is not connected,
- or a disconnect button for the opposite case,
- ask the user to change his wallet network if it is connected to the wrong chain.

Let's see what we have for now. 

You can see some constants already declared: `AVALANCHE_TESTNET_PARAMS` and `ETHEREUM_TESTNET_PARAMS`.
Those variables are network configurations. We've put them for you, but know you can find them on [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/).

Then, we have an empty component. For now, it does not contain any logic, but some UI. 
Here we can start working üí™.

The first step here is to remove the `return null` statement and uncomment the next `return` statement. 
You should now see the connect button displayed on the interface.

We've put a static variable `isActive` to `false`. We want to get this value from the wallet instead. 
For that, we will call the `useWebReact` hook. This hook returns an object containing an `isActive` property. 
Perfect, this is exactly what we want! 

```typescript
  const { isActive } = useWeb3React<Web3Provider>()
```

Ok, now we know if we are connected directly from the wallet, nice.
But, as we are not connected, we want to handle the connection. 
For that, the goal is to fill the `connect` function.  

From the hook, we will get an additional property: `connector`.
This is the metaMask object, allowing us to interact with the wallet. 

```typescript
  const { isActive, connector } = useWeb3React();
```

We call the `activate` method from the connector to connect to the user's wallet.  
We can also provide the target blockchain information as a parameter.  
We already created a file exporting those pieces of information for you.

It should look like this

```typescript
  async function connect() {
    await connector.activate(ETHEREUM_TESTNET_PARAMS)
  }
```

Time to test!

If we want to handle errors, we need to surround the `activate` calls with a try/catch.  

```typescript
  async function connect() {
    try {
    setError(undefined)
    await connector.activate(ETHEREUM_TESTNET_PARAMS)
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e)
      setError(e as Error)
    }
  }
```

Here we also reset the error state before trying to connect.

### Connection testing

To test a wallet connection, you need to first have a Wallet.  
You should already have one so, let's go click our connect button.   
You should see a pop-up asking you to approve the connection to our website.
If you accept, you should then see your address instead of the login button. 

Awesome! Here, you have the "Web3" kind of login. You have the public identifier of your user!
Isn't it a kind way to connect? üòÅ

If you wonder what's under the button, you can look for **`Web3WalletButton` component**.  
It calls the hook `useWeb3React`, and gets the connected address, and the active props.

From the `isActive` props, we decide what we display: a truncated address or a connection button.

The parent component `Web3WalletConnector` displayed an additional logout button when we are connected.

We still have to complete the disconnected behavior. 

From the `connector`, call the function `resetState` into the `disconnect` function and we are good! Good Job! üôå

## Integrate and interact with your smart contract
Duration: 0:15:00

For now, we implemented the connection with our wallet. That's already great,
but we're here to interact with our smart contract right? Let's goooo üßë‚Äçüíª

The frontend and the web3 library need to know what is the structure of our contract. 
This means:

- the public data exposed,
- public functions,
- events (yeah, the Ethereum Virtual Machine aka EVM has built-in support for events)

And there is a file containing all those information, 
produced on the smart contract build: the JSON artifact.

In the contract package, look for the `artifacts/contracts/` folder.
Find the file with the name of our contract, and take a look at the content.

It contains all the information our frontend needs. üéâ

OK, now we know what we have, let's think about what we want. 

The goal will be to mint our NFT, finally!  
To achieve that, we want to call our smart contract function `makeAnEpicNFT`, 
and listen to the event `NewNFTMinted`.  
From the event, we will get the token id, and display an URL to be able to see it.  

We have created for you the `Mint` (`MintButton.tsx`) component containing the structure so we can focus 
on the business logic. Take a look at this component.

We have two functions to fill: `setupEventListener` and `askContractToMintNft`.  
The first one will listen to the mint event on our contract, and the second will call our 
contract to mint the NFT.  

The component return `null` if `isActive` is `false`, and a button otherwise.  
This means if you are connected, the button should appear.

Let's go!

The first thing is to replace the `isActive` variable to get it from the `useWeb3React` hook.  
We already did it, so it should be easy üòõ

Take also the `provider` property from the hook, we will need it. It's better to give 
`Web3Provider` as a generic parameter to the hook. It will type the `provider` property for us.

We take `provider` here because we need it to call the blockchain.  

Let's code the event listener. It's the "easier" part, and we will be able to 
understand the basics.

### Event Listener

First, the variable `provider` can be `undefined`, so we need to verify it isn't.  

```ts
  const setupEventListener = useCallback(() => {
    if (!provider) {
      return
    }
  }
```

Then, because of the inherited behavior of `ethers` provider, we need to get the transaction `signer`.  

```typescript
    const signer = provider.getSigner()
```

Secondly, we will create a contract client instance.  

```ts
    const connectedContract = new Contract(
      // ...
    )
```

This constructor takes 3 arguments:

- The contract address,
- The contract ABI (Application Binary Interface). It is a sub-part of the JSON artifact we talked about before,
- The `signer` variable we created before. It will be used to sign transactions.

Let's fill them in one by one.  

On the top of the file, we've created a `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` constant to replace. Put here the contract address 
you got when you deployed your contract.  

For the abi, you can import it from our `contract` package:

```typescript
import myEpicNft from "my-epic-nft/artifacts/contracts/MyEpicSmartContract.sol/MyEpicSmartContract.json";
//                      ^- package name in the `package.json`
```

And for the signers, we've created a variable for it, perfect!  

We should have this: 

```typescript
    const signer = provider.getSigner()
    const connectedContract = new Contract(
      CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      myEpicNft.abi,
      // @ts-ignore the typing of Signer is out of date.
      signer
    )
```

Now we have a contract client instance, we can interact with our contract!  
To listen to events, we need to call the `on` method and pass it our event name `NewNFTMinted` as the first parameter, and a callback as the second parameter.  
The first argument of the callback is the contract address, and the second is the return type 
of the method called (here the token id is a big number).

Our UI will be simple. We will display an alert with the received information.

```typescript
    connectedContract.on('NewNFTMinted', (from, tokenId) => {
      console.log(from, tokenId)
      alert(
        `Hey there! We've minted your NFT and sent it to your wallet. You can see it in metasmask, just import it ! Contract is ${CONTRACT_ADDRESS} and tokenId is ${tokenId}`
      )
      setIsLoading(false)
    })
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è The `ethers` provider used under the hood is not perfect here, and we lose our strong typing üò≠

To remove the event listening, we will return a cleanup function from the hook.  

```typescript
return () => {
  connectedContract.off('NewNFTMinted')
}
```

Finally, add `provider` and `setIsLoading` in the dependency array of `useCallback` (second argument). This tells react to recompute the function if the `provider` changes.

üôå We have a listener set up! üôå But we can't test it without minting an NFT, so let's do that!

### LET'S MINT

Here we go! The final part!  

Here we will fill in the `askContractToMintNft` function. But this one has a bit much logic to handle.  

When the user will click on the button, it will fire our function.  
Our component only has an SVG HTML element reference. But we want our NFT to have an actual image!  
So the first step will be to create an image from the element we have.  

Then, we have to store it. But on the blockchain, we pay for every storage we use, and we don't 
want the mint to be overly expensive!

Here, we have 2 solutions.  
The first one: stores our image in an S3 bucket for example. But we want to create a 
decentralized application! What happens to our NFT if the S3 is deleted? We have only data, but no 
image attached to it. We will have a broken NFT.
The second one: store it on IPFS, which is a decentralized storage. It seems a lot better, right? üòÅ 
But IPFS has some issues too. It's a protocol, which means the user will have to install the protocol
on his computer to interact with or use a gateway. Which is centralized üòÖ

Here, we will use a gateway deployed on AWS. Some libraries allow us to run a minimal 
IPFS node in JavaScript in the browser. It would be a better solution since doing that we don't 
have a single point of failure. Never mind, for our little project the gateway solution was fun!

Enough talk, let's code!

First, we will inform the UI we're doing some stuff and it needs to display a loader.  
We've received a `setIsLoading` method from props, so let's call it.  

```typescript
    setIsLoading(true)
```

Then, we will verify we do have an SVG element or throw an error otherwise.  

```typescript
    if (!svgRef.current) {
      throw new Error('No SVG')
    }
```

Now we're sure we have an SVG element, let's create an image from it.  
Thankfully, we've created a `getSvgImageFromSvgElement` function for you ü´°

```typescript
    const svg = await getSvgImageFromSvgElement(svgRef.current)
```

And let's upload it to IPFS. Here too, you have a `uploadToIPFS` function to make your life easier ü´°
This function takes an object parameter with 2 properties: `svg` and `name`

```typescript
    const cid = await uploadSvgToIPFS({
      svg,
      name: `nft ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
    })
```

Now we have a unique identifier for our stored image. Exactly what our contract needs üòÅ

We can call our contract. Remember the "get the signer", "create a contract instance" stuff?  
We will repeat it here. 

> - "Gnagnagna that's a code duplication" 
> YES IT IS! Two time duplication is ok, if this code was repeated 3,4,5 times, 
> we would have created an abstraction.

```typescript
    const signer = provider.getSigner()
    const connectedContract = new ethers.Contract(
      CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      myEpicNft.abi,
      // @ts-ignore the typing of Signer is out of date.
      signer
    )
```

Nooooooow, we can create a transaction üî•

Before we was listening to an event, so we called `on` the method. Here to call a distributed method,
we can directly call the method on the contract instance.  

If your IDE does not autocomplete, it's normal, the contract does not infer our ABI, and it's really
sad üò≠. We plan to try [this new client library](https://wagmi.sh/) that fixes this problem

```typescript
    await connectedContract.makeAnEpicNFT(`ipfs://${cid}`)
```

TIME TO TEST!

## Bonus
Duration: 0:15:00

As a bonus, you can update the smart-contract to add new features.  
Feel free to invent one! Distributed technologies offer endless possibilities!

Here are some ideas:

- Restrict the mint to one NFT per user,
- Limit the total amount of ducks possibles (rarity),
- Store duck properties  
  This will allow other possibilities:
  - Have some inheritance, a duck could inherit some properties of his parent,
  - Turn them into fighting ducks with combat properties,
  - etc...

We're not guiding you for the bonus, but feel free to reach out for help ü§úü§õ

And at the end, tell us what you've made ü´∂.
