# Initiation solidity and Web3.0



## Init your project ðŸ”¨
Duration: 0:05:00

If you have not done it yet, you can start by cloning this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gosunet/workshop-initiation-solidity-web3.git
```

### Setup Hardat

[Hardat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start) is a framework that will help us to :
- compile our smart contract
- test our smart contract
- deploy our smart contract

If you feel adventurous you can alternatively use [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/) or [Fundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). Both are pretty similar to Hardat in term of features.

Install hardat 
```sh
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

Then init hardat 
```sh
npx hardhat
```

This will create folders :

- `contracts` : folder for our solidity files,

- `scripts` : a directory that contain scripts to handle deploy, run, ...

- `test`: unit test sources,

- `hardat-config.js` : config file for Hardat

Finally, run `npx hardhat node` and this should print out a bunch of accounts.

Hardat will generate some files for you, to make sure everything is working, run:

```sh
 npx hardhat compile
```

Then run:

```sh
 npx hardhat test
```

You should see a bunch of tests succeeded ðŸŽ‰

You can now delete Lock.js under test, deploy.js under scripts and Lock.sol under contracts. (not the folder !)
